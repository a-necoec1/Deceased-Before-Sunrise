"Deceased Before Sunrise" is a horror survival game where you have to survive in a forest in the middle of the night,
and grab six generators before the time is up. You have 5 minutes (or 300 seconds) to find these generators, and not get
caught by the monster lurking around the forest. The generators are scattered around the map, and each time you use one in
the car, the safety area increases to push back the monster. This tries to follow the Scream Jam theme of horror by having
a monster chase you around, while having a time limit to pressure you into beating the game. This game is set in a forest
in the middle of the night too.
